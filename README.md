Telecom Domain Analysis: Impact of 5G Launch on AtliQ's Performance
Project Overview
AtliQ, a leading telecom provider in India, launched its 5G plans in May 2022, competing alongside other telecom giants. Post-launch, AtliQ observed a concerning decline in active users and revenue growth. To address this issue, a comprehensive comparison report of key performance indicators (KPIs) between the pre and post-5G periods was requested. This analysis aims to understand the impact of 5G on AtliQ's performance and identify strategies to recover active user growth and overall revenue.

Key Insights
Revenue: Dropped by 0.50% after the 5G launch.
ARPU (Average Revenue Per User): Increased by 11.05% after the 5G launch.
Monthly Active Users: Dropped by 8.28% after the 5G launch.
Churn Rate: Increased by 1.99% after the 5G launch.
Internet Combo Plans: Performing well post-5G launch.
Key Conclusions & Recommendations
Plan Optimization: Refocus on plans 4, 5, 6, and 7, and optimize newly introduced plans 11, 12, and 13 to attract more active users.
Regional Focus: Prioritize strategies in Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata to balance ARPU with customer churn. Additionally, introduce attractive plans and offers in Patna, Coimbatore, Chandigarh, Gurgaon, and Raipur to boost engagement.
Strategic Reevaluation: Re-evaluate strategy based on the successful first 4 months of the pre-5G phase, despite steady market value growth across cities.
