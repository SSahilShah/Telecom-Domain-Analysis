Telecom Domain Analysis: Impact of 5G Launch on AtliQ's Performance 📊
AtliQ, a leading telecom provider in India, launched its 5G plans in May 2022 alongside other telecom giants.
However, post-5G launch, AtliQ noticed a concerning decline in its active users and revenue growth. To address this, the management requested a comprehensive comparison report of key performance indicators (KPIs) between the pre and post-5G periods.
The goal is to understand the impact of 5G on AtliQ's performance and identify strategies to recover active user growth and overall revenue.

Key Insights:
After 5G, Revenue dropped by -0.50%. 📉
After 5G, ARPU increased by 11.05%. 📈
After 5G, Monthly Active Users dropped by -8.28%. 📉
After 5G, Churn Rate increased by 1.99%. 📈
After 5G, internet combo plans are performing well. 👍
✨ Key Conclusions & Recommendations:
As we've witnessed increased plan revenue amidst a declining trend of active users and growing unsubscribed customers post-5G, we need to refocus on plans 4, 5, 6, and 7, while also optimizing the newly introduced plans 11, 12, and 13 to attract more active users.
To balance average revenue per user (ARPU) with customer churn, we recommend prioritizing Mumbai, Delhi, and Kolkata. Additionally, introducing attractive plans and offers in Patna, Coimbatore, Chandigarh, Gurgaon, and Raipur (the bottom 5 revenue-generating cities) can boost engagement.
Despite steady market value growth across cities, our market share has declined in recent months. Re-evaluating our strategy based on the successful first 4 months of the pre-5G phase is crucial.
